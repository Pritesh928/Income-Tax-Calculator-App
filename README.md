# Income-Tax-Calculator-App
This is an android application i have made as my first ever application using xml-frontend. java-backend in android studio
You can add your annual income and get the value of how much income tax you have to pay.
Note:-This is based on formulae by calculating
1. 0.05 * income (basic income tax) + 0.04 * income (tax cess).
2. This how this basic app calculates your income tax returns value in (INR).
